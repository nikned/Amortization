Amortization Formula:

        This will get you your monthly payment.
        M = P * (J / (1 - (Math.pow(1/(1 + J), N))));

        Where:
             P = Principal
             I = Interest
             J = Monthly Interest in decimal form:  I / (12 * 100)
             N = Number of months of loan
             M = Monthly Payment Amount
